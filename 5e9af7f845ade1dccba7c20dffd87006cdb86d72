I don't see why this is needed.
0 or AUDIO_DEVICE_NONE is a convention indicated no device selection which is valid for both input and output devices.
This parameter is sent to an input stream so the context clearly indicates it is a input device that is reset to none.
Changing this would cause audio HALs comparing the value to 0 to not work anymore.
